class MAIRCA(MCDA_method):
    """ Multi-Attributive RealIdeal Comparative Analysis (MARICA) method.

        The MAIRCA method is based on an assumption in which it determines the gap between ideal and empirical rates.\

        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <MAIRCA>`.

        Parameters
        ----------
            normalization_function : callable
                Function which should be used to normalize `matrix` columns. It should match signature `foo(x, cost)`,
                where `x` is a vector which should be normalized and `cost` is a bool variable which says if `x` is a
                cost or profit criterion.

            ----------
                matrix : ndarray
                    Decision matrix / alternatives data.
                    Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

                weights : ndarray
                    Criteria weights. Sum of the weights should be 1. (e.g. sum(weights) == 1)

                types : ndarray
                    Array with definitions of criteria types:
                    1 if criteria is profit and -1 if criteria is cost for each criteria in `matrix`.

                *args: is necessary for methods which reqiure some additional data.

            -------
                ndarray
                    Preference values for alternatives. Better alternatives have higher values.
