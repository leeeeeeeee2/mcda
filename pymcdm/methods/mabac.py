class MABAC(MCDA_method):
    """ Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) method.

        The MABAC method is based on determining the distance measure between each possible alternative and the Boundary
        Approximation Area (BAA).

        Parameters
        ----------
           normalization_function : callable
               Function which should be used to normalize `matrix` columns. It should match signature `foo(x, cost)`,
               where `x` is a vector which should be normalized and `cost` is a bool variable which says if `x` is a
               cost or profit criterion.

            ----------
                matrix : ndarray

                    Criteria weights. Sum of the weights should be 1. (e.g. sum(weights) == 1)

                    Array with definitions of criteria types:

            -------
